# XapiIban

## Description

XapiIban is a angular 4 application I developped as a proof of concept for [Santander](http://www.santander.co.uk). It is a revamp of their internationnal payment experience. The goal of the POC was two-fold, prove the user experience can be improved and prove it is possible to write reusable components that could be used in different sectors of the bank. I achieved this by building a demo angular 2 component that pulls other angular 2 npm packages I wrote.
